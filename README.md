# Non-Adiabatic-Quenches

## Abstract

Using computational techniques such as Quantum Circuit Models, implemented in the Python programming language using IBM's Qiskit, we simulate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the 1D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM). Spin correlation propagation was studied using a quantum quench from the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase under periodic boundary conditions. It was shown that for specific quantum devices like IBMâ€™s Kyiv, unmitigated noisy experiments using Hamiltonian Trotterization for long real-time evolutions are unfeasible due to current depolarizing errors on one- and two-qubit gates. Despite this, noiseless simulation data allowed us to make a reasonable estimate of the velocity of spin correlations, supported by a near equivalence to a contextual calculation using the analytical solution as developed by Jordan and Wigner (JW).

After a JW, Fourier and Bogoliubov transform of the 1D periodic TFIM hamiltonian, the following maximum velocity of spin correlation velocity is calculated:

$$
v(k = \frac{\pi}{2a}) \approx 0.9 \quad (\text{in units of } \frac{J_a}{\hbar})
$$

Where a is the lattice spacing, and J the coupling constant.
